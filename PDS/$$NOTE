 Hi Sam,

 Here it is: an example of CSVLLIX1 exit, for the CBT
 TAPE.  The exit itself was prepared and is being used
 at a customer site in Italy.

 I just copied it on another MVS, and polished it until
 everything compiled fine using only the source PDS.

 All comments are in English, but a bit of Italian may
 be found in some macro.  The exit in itself just
 maintains in memory a table of usage of selected LLA
 modules from selected MVS address spaces, as specified
 by the user. A couple of related programs can be used
 to print the table contents themselves.

 In real life it is being used to decide which modules
 it is better to preload in an IMS region.
